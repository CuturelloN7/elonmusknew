                               <p class= "one">Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, the son of Maye Musk, a model and dietitian from<br> 
                                Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor.<br> 
                                He has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca. <br>
                                His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.<br>
                                His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.<br>
                                After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria.<br>
                                He has a half-sister and a half-brother.<br>
                                During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader. At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.<br> 
                                He taught himself computer programming at the age of 10, and by the age of 12 sold the code of a BASIC-based<br>
                                video game he created called <a href="https://blastar-1984.appspot.com/" style="color: rgb(240, 144, 0)">Blastar</a>, to a magazine called PC and Office Technology, for approximately $500.<br>
                                A web version of the game is available online. His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series,<br>
                                from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization,<br>
                                minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one".<br><br>
                                    
                                Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.<br>
                                Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States.<br>
                                As he states, "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world."<br> 
                                Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989,<br>
                                just before his 18th birthday, after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.</p>
