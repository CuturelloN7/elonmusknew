                    Musk clearly gives priority to the things that matter most to him in his life. <br>
                    His reasoning is that it does not matter about any bad circumstances that can happen<br> if the odds are against him, 
                    he simply must act because it is what he feels is correct.<br>
                    Also Musk has faith in creating his own journey.<br> He feels that the key to having a positive life is to awake each day, full of belief that things will go his way.<br>
                    Elon Musk is very clearly focused on constant improvement. <br> Once his projects are finalised, he looks at ways to make them better.</p>
